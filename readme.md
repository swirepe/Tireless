*Now in use by Brandeis University's English Department*


## What Is It

Tireless is a combination of [the pomodoro technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) and `from random import choice`.  You give it some tasks that you want to complete, and it chooses one for you and gives you 25 minutes to work on it.

Tireless is Chrome only.

## Why Is It

Sometimes flipping a coin is the best way to get things started.
